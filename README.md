# BulkImageCreator
Contains script to create bulk images using python with numbers written on them for easy image identification. These images can be uploaded on GitHub for a web browseable url.

I had created this repo so that I have a tool to create several images for FB catalog testing.

# Usage
`python create_multiple_images.py` - change configs and function params to het different results
OR
`python3 create_multiple_images.py` - change configs and function params to het different results

# Dependencies

There is a dependency on PIL (Python Image Library):

## If using Python 2.7:
`pip install PIP`

## If using Python3.5+:
`python3 -m pip install Pillow`
