# BulkImageCreator
Contains script to create bulk images using python with numbers written on them for easy image identification. These images can be uploaded on GitHub for a web browseable url.

I had created this repo so that I have a tool to create several images for FB catalog testing.


# Usage
`python create_multiple_images.py` - change configs and function params to het different results

# Depemndency on PIL (Python Image Library)
Install as below:
`pip install PIP`
